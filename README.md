# Micrium-Integration-in-IAR-with-NucleoL152re
This project deals with integrating Micrium OS from scratch in the IAR world. The target board is Nucleo-L152re that contains the STM32L152re microcontroller. This project also includes a small application developed to understand different following Micrium Services like Task Management (Task Creation), Scheduling, Tasks Priority, Interrupt Management, Interaction between two tasks, Interaction between a task and an interrupt,  IPC (Message Queues) and Resource Sharing and Protection (Mutex). The application also involves dealing with different hardware peripheral of the microcontrollers like GPIO, I2C and USART.
One thing to keep in mind about IAR is that the IAR project structure is not according to the the File Explorer of the OS. We can literally import files from different directories and keep them in the same 'group' in IAR. IAR deals with groups.
The Micirum OS software can be downloaded from the internet (it is open-source now). I got it from a repository made by Jack (an ex-employee at BH)
I followed Jack's method and arranged the Micrium OS files accordingly in the project to integrate Micrium OS source code.
After successful integration of Micrium OS, I developed a small application to learn more about the Micrium OS services mentioned above.
